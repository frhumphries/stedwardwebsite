## National & Statewide Quarantine

Due to the COVID quarantine, all public celebrations of the Holy Mass have been cancelled until further notice. Fr. Ryan is working in cooperation with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) which he co-founded about 10 years ago with Fr. Chris Decker of the Diocese of Baton Rouge. Two Holy Masses will be offered and livestreamed every morning - one in English (the "Ordinary Form") and one in the Traditional Latin ("Extraordinary") Form. Night prayer and the Stations of the Cross will be offered according to the schedule below.

Further information from Archbishop Aymond regarding the re-opening of Public Masses is available at [DioceseAlex.org](http://www.diocesealex.org).

## Watch (and\or Rewatch)

_Note that most videos begin with a still image, but the video is playing. If you're watching live, Fr. Ryan will try to start the live feed about 5 minutes before the event is scheduled to begin. If you are watching an event recorded earlier, you can move the slider at the bottom of the video window or just wait a few minute until the image fades out and the actual video begins to play. This is done in order to give folks who want to watch the live stream a few moments to orient themselves._

### An Act of Spiritual Communion

> _O Most amiable Savior! Who was the perpetual object and reigning desire of the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, and of all the Saints of the Old Testament, who sighed incessantly for Your Incarnation, come into my soul, which burns with the desire of receiving You, and of being united to You, as the Author of my salvation, and the source of all good. Come and destroy within me the tyranny of sin and self-love, and establish there the reign of You grace and charity. In Your mercy grant me to partake of Your spirit, and of Your virtues, through the desire I have of receiving You in the Most Holy Sacrament._

> _No, my Jesus, I cannot leave You, not live without You: You only can satisfy my heart and make me happy. O you Seraphim! Who ardently desire to be sacramentally united to Jesus Christ, yet cannot, I unite myself to the ardor and purity of your desires, to be united to the same God Whom with me you adore upon the altar. But, O Lord, come and purify my heart from all attachment to myself or to creatures, my heart which was made but to love and to possess You. You alone can satisfy it, and all that is not You is as nothing._

> _O amiable God! O Loving God! can I know You and not love You, and love You and not burn with desire to receive You on Earth, and to see and to possess You forever in Heaven?_

> _Amen_
