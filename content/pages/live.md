## National & Statewide Quarantine

Due to the State-wide quarantine, all celebrations of the Holy Mass are cancelled until further notice. St Edward will attempt to provide a live-stream of Mass every morning at 9:15am which will be shared on Fr. Ryan's Twitter feed (twitter.com/frhumphries) and on his Facebook page (Facebook.com/frhumphries).

Fr. Ryan is working in cooperating with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) (which he co-founded about 10 years ago with Fr. Chris Decker of the Diocese of Baton Rouge), Mass will be offered and livestreamed every morning at 8:30a. Night prayer will be offered Sun-Fri evenings at 9pm). Both are available on Fr. Decker's parish website ([triparishes.org/live](http://triparishes.org/live)).

As soon as new information becomes available, it will be available at those same sources. Further information is available at DioceseAlex.org.
