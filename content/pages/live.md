## National & Statewide Quarantine

Due to the State-wide quarantine, all celebrations of the Holy Mass are cancelled until further notice. St Edward will attempt to provide a live-stream of Mass every morning at 9:15am which will be shared on Fr. Ryan's Twitter feed ([twitter.com/frhumphries](http://www.twitter.com/frhumphries)) and on his Facebook page ([Facebook.com/frhumphries](http://www.facebook.com/frhumphries)).

Fr. Ryan is working in cooperation with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) (which he co-founded about 10 years ago with Fr. Chris Decker of the Diocese of Baton Rouge), Mass will be offered and livestreamed every morning. Night prayer will be offered Mon-Fri evenings at 9pm). Both are also available on Fr. Decker's parish website ([triparishes.org/live](http://triparishes.org/live)).

As soon as new information becomes available, it will be available here and at the above sources.

Information from Archbishop Aymond is available at [DioceseAlex.org](http://www.diocesealex.org).
