## National & Statewide Quarantine

Just before May 1, 2020, Archbishop Aymond, acting as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese allowed pastors to re-establish a public Mass schedule under specific safety conditions. This follows a general cancellation of all religious services several weeks before Easter of this year.

**At this time, all Catholics in the Diocese of Alexandria are still not obligated to attend Sunday Mass on the order of the Archbishop. Our new Bishop, +Robert Marshall has confirmed this order and will lift the order at a date to be determined.**

Beginning May 4th:

- All Masses will be offered in the "Ordinary Form" (English, Modern form) except where otherwise indicated.
- No more than ten people in total (including the priest) may attend any service or gathering.
- Holy Communion is available only under the single species of the Sacred Host.
- All are asked and expected to observe the precepts of "social distancing." Masks and gloves are welcome and recommended, but not required.
- All daily Masses will be open to the public on a first-come-first-served basis. If you arrive and nine others are present, you won't be able to come in.
- Sunday morning Masses will be available for live-stream only until Louisiana enters Phase I of quarantine relief. At that time, the Saturday evening Mass will be restored and both Sunday Masses will be available to the public with "Social Distancing", etc. Until that time, Fr. Ryan will provide several brief Communion Services throughout Sunday Morning to allow for as many as would like to come and receive Holy Communion. Contant Anne Keene for reservations.
- Fr. Ryan is available and happy to bring Holy Communion to you in your home.

Fr. Ryan has been working in cooperation with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) to provide broad opportunities to assist at Mass over the internet and he will continue to do so until such time as a full Mass schedule can be re-established.

Further information from Archbishop Aymond regarding the re-opening of Public Masses is available at [DioceseAlex.org](http://www.diocesealex.org).

## Watch (and\or Rewatch)

_Note that most videos begin with a still image, but the video is playing. If you're watching live, Fr. Ryan will try to start the live feed about 5 minutes before the event is scheduled to begin. If you are watching an event recorded earlier, you can move the slider at the bottom of the video window or just wait a few minute until the image fades out and the actual video begins to play. This is done in order to give folks who want to watch the live stream a few moments to orient themselves._

### An Act of Spiritual Communion

> _O Most amiable Savior! Who was the perpetual object and reigning desire of the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, and of all the Saints of the Old Testament, who sighed incessantly for Your Incarnation, come into my soul, which burns with the desire of receiving You, and of being united to You, as the Author of my salvation, and the source of all good. Come and destroy within me the tyranny of sin and self-love, and establish there the reign of You grace and charity. In Your mercy grant me to partake of Your spirit, and of Your virtues, through the desire I have of receiving You in the Most Holy Sacrament._

> _No, my Jesus, I cannot leave You, not live without You: You only can satisfy my heart and make me happy. O you Seraphim! Who ardently desire to be sacramentally united to Jesus Christ, yet cannot, I unite myself to the ardor and purity of your desires, to be united to the same God Whom with me you adore upon the altar. But, O Lord, come and purify my heart from all attachment to myself or to creatures, my heart which was made but to love and to possess You. You alone can satisfy it, and all that is not You is as nothing._

> _O amiable God! O Loving God! can I know You and not love You, and love You and not burn with desire to receive You on Earth, and to see and to possess You forever in Heaven?_

> _Amen_
