## National & Statewide Quarantine

Just before May 1, 2020, Archbishop Aymond, acting as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese allowed pastors to re-establish a public Mass schedule under specific safety conditions. This follows a general cancellation of all religious services several weeks before Easter of this year.

**At this time, all Catholics in the Dioceses of Alexandria and Shreveport are not obligated to attend Sunday Mass on the order of the Archbishop of New Orleans, Greg Aymond, Bishop Marshall of the Diocese of Alexandria and Bp. Malone of the Diocese of Shreveport. That order will be lifted by each Bishop in due course.**

At St. Edward,

- No more than fifty people in total may attend any service or gathering.
- All are asked and expected to observe the precepts of "social distancing." Masks and gloves are welcome and strongly recommended, but not required.
- Holy Communion is available only under the single species of the Sacred Host.
- Our weekly schedule will be gradually adjusted to resemble our usual pre-COVID schedule.
  - Saturday and Sunday Masses are presently back to normal (Sat 5:30p & Sun 9:00a).
  - Daily Masses will be offered Tue, Wed, Thu at 9:00a and Friday at 5:30p.
  - Only Masses which are indicated will be live-streamed.
  - When the Legacy Nursing Home (AKA The Olive Branch) reopens for Public Mass, the Thursday Mass will take place there.
  - THANK YOU for your patience with us and for your cooperation!

Further information from Archbishop Aymond and Bishop Marshall regarding the re-opening of Public Masses is available at [DioceseAlex.org](http://www.diocesealex.org).

## Watch (and\or Rewatch)

_Note that most videos begin with a still image, but the video is playing. If you're watching live, Fr. Ryan will try to start the live feed about 5 minutes before the event is scheduled to begin. If you are watching an event recorded earlier, you can move the slider at the bottom of the video window or just wait a few minute until the image fades out and the actual video begins to play. This is done in order to give folks who want to watch the live stream a few moments to orient themselves._

### An Act of Spiritual Communion

> _O Most amiable Savior! Who was the perpetual object and reigning desire of the ancient Patriarchs and Prophets, and of all the Saints of the Old Testament, who sighed incessantly for Your Incarnation, come into my soul, which burns with the desire of receiving You, and of being united to You, as the Author of my salvation, and the source of all good. Come and destroy within me the tyranny of sin and self-love, and establish there the reign of You grace and charity. In Your mercy grant me to partake of Your spirit, and of Your virtues, through the desire I have of receiving You in the Most Holy Sacrament._

> _No, my Jesus, I cannot leave You, not live without You: You only can satisfy my heart and make me happy. O you Seraphim! Who ardently desire to be sacramentally united to Jesus Christ, yet cannot, I unite myself to the ardor and purity of your desires, to be united to the same God Whom with me you adore upon the altar. But, O Lord, come and purify my heart from all attachment to myself or to creatures, my heart which was made but to love and to possess You. You alone can satisfy it, and all that is not You is as nothing._

> _O amiable God! O Loving God! can I know You and not love You, and love You and not burn with desire to receive You on Earth, and to see and to possess You forever in Heaven?_

> _Amen_
