## National & Statewide Quarantine

Due to the COVID quarantine, all public celebrations of the Holy Mass have been cancelled until further notice. Fr. Ryan is working in cooperation with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) which he co-founded about 10 years ago with Fr. Chris Decker of the Diocese of Baton Rouge. Two Holy Masses will be offered and livestreamed every morning - one in English (the "Ordinary Form") and one in the Traditional Latin ("Extraordinary") Form. Night prayer and the Stations of the Cross will be offered according to the schedule below.

Further information from Archbishop Aymond regarding the re-opening of Public Masses is available at [DioceseAlex.org](http://www.diocesealex.org).

## Watch (and\or Rewatch)

_Note that most videos begin with a still image, the video is playing. You can move the slider at the bottom of the video window or just wait a minute or two until the image fades out and the actual video begins to play. This is done in order to give folks who want to watch the live stream a few moments to orient themselves._
