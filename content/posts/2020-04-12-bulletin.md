description: "Easter Sunday is formally called the Solemnity of the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ. We celebrate today the fulfillment of the so-called Paschal Mystery in which Jesus suffers and dies to fulfill God's divine justice but then rises from the dead in promise of mercy to be shown to us who have sinned and repented and turned the Lord. This mysterious and seemingly contradictory pattern is at the heart of the Christian Life."

_On the first day of the week_

In the ancient world, every day was basically the same. The weather changed. Maybe a king was overthrown. But each day was much the same as the one before. So was each week and each year. The ancient world just didn't change much. The same family might live in the same house for three or four generations. A handful of events created massive and sudden change, but if you didn't live in an area that was effected, life stayed the same. From the ancient days until the re-urbinization of Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the first day of the week was indistinguishable from the fourth or the seventh. In the last two to three hundred years, though, the world has been defined by near-constant change. _Tomorrow is a new day_ may as well be our modern day mantra as even the most offensive and life-shattering events are forgotten in mere hours. No sin is too big to be overlooked unless the news media keep reminding us of it and even then, our obsessive need for something new eventually overwhelms us.

This idolatry of novelty is particularly challenging for us as Christians. _Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever._ Jesus hasn't come to satisfy our urges or to be relevant to our day and age; He's come to transform us (and our society) into the image and likeness of the Most Holy Trinity. Jesus has come to reorient us from fads to family, from likes on social media to an unchanging, unevolving love which satisfies in a way that no meme, cat video or instagram post ever could.

The _first day of the week_ is meant to be an icon of new and eternal (that is, non-changing) life which promises to do replace the idol of the daily grind. In the ancient world, people associated the first day with freedom from the daily toil of working just to earn enough to eat for a day and then waking up wondering where their food would come from. Sadly, the poor in our day still live that life. For most of you reading this, though, the first day of the week can and should offer an opportunity to put aside the rat race... The Lord offers us a life driven by genuine fulfillment, meaning, purpose and the peace of the Holy Spirit. Even though most of us don't wake up with an empty belly and no coffers to fill it, most of us spend our days chasing after other things which will pass away much sooner than we'd like. Whether that's entertainment, contentment, the approval of friends and family or something else.

The most astounding promise of the Lord is a change in perspective. What if we weren't driven by the daily grind? What if we recognized in our daily lives eternal possibilities and realities? What if pleasure became something that merely pointed beyond itself to the true joy of Heaven AND what if suffering wasn't a roadblock in itself but it pointed beyond itself to the true suffering or Hell? What if we found in prayer the same peace we have to look for elsewhere? What if we found in works of mercy a lasting satisfaction that we usually have to look for in temporary bits elsewhere?

This year, Easter is a small relief which only anticipates a much greater relief that we hope to receive from our civil government... But what if that inversion speaks more eloquently to the problems in our society, our Church and our lives than any sermon ever could? There were a great many saints whose circumstances were more dire than our own and who came to realize and recognize that true freedom doesn't come from the absence of a pandemic or the relaxation of _social distancing_ policies. Rather, love, peace, joy and happiness are all aspects of the same thing: nearness to Jesus Christ. _The first day of the week_ is an icon of this newness which is really not very new at all. Jesus Christ is, after all, _the same yesterday, today and forever._

## How-To Watch Mass Online

Due to the COVID quarantine, all public celebrations of the Holy Mass have been cancelled until further notice. Fr. Ryan is working in cooperation with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) which he co-founded about 10 years ago with Fr. Chris Decker of the Diocese of Baton Rouge. Two Holy Masses will be offered and live-streamed every morning - one in English (the "Ordinary Form") and one in the Traditional Latin ("Extraordinary") Form.

_Note that most videos begin with a still image, but the video is playing. If you're watching live, Fr. Ryan will try to start the live feed about 5 minutes before the event is scheduled to begin. If you are watching an event recorded earlier, you can move the slider at the bottom of the video window or just wait a few minute until the image fades out and the actual video begins to play. This is done in order to give folks who want to watch the live stream a few moments to orient themselves._
