It's purpose is to orient us not only to the suffering that Jesus is to endure, but even moreso to give us a sense that the Passion of Jesus is a journey through death and into the glorious Easter Light of Heaven..."

## Thoughts from Fr. Ryan

_"I am innocent of this man’s blood." - Pilate_

In many ways, Pilate gives us the perfect example of how to run headlong toward eternal damnation in Hell. Every sin that we've ever committed is just a mishmash of his words here in the Gospel... "I know this or that is wrong, but I am innocent because... reasons." What makes it so very sad is that he's pretending that he's not to blame for such petty reasons. Pilate believes he's innocent because... there's an angry crowd? The Roman Province of Judea was a constantly at war with itself or with the broader empire. Pilate literally executed hundreds of people a monthm and yet he wants to pretend that his hands are clean just because there were "good" reasons for his actions.

We do the same thing. We have some motivation. Maybe we want to be well thought of. Maybe we want to experience pleasure. Maybe we want to get ahead. Maybe we believe that we're right and the moral law is wrong. Whatever our reasons, we do what Pilate did. We claim that our reasons were justifiable and so we do what it is we do and believe that we have clean hands. And that's a problem. Sin is bad. Sin is deadly. The worse problem, though, comes after the sin when we see what's we've done in the cool light of day. Just as Pilate looks at himself after condemning Jesus.

All of us can and do make mistakes. _All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God._ But when we realize, what do we do? Do we repent or do we justify our actions to ourselves. I think the biggest struggle we have as Catholics is the same struggle Pilate had. He didn't want to face himself. We live in a society in which are strongly encouraged not to look within ourselves. We're told to judge the opinions of others, not engage them. We're told to fill up our lives with busyness and activity so that we never risk sitting alone and thinking about the big questions. Confession, though, makes that all but impossible. We have to face ourselves. There's no real reason to be embarrassed about confessing one's sins to the priest, but there's a real anxiety in confronting ourselves with our sins. The real path to Hell isn't sin, it's what takes place after we sin. Do we acknowledge our sin and ask forgiveness of God and His Church or do we make excuses... Confession can be uncomfortable. It can be embarassing or humiliating. It can be something we don't like to do and don't want to do. But none of those are any more acceptable to God than Pilate's self-delusion. Forgiveness from God is not automatic and it's not just a matter of looking up and saying "please forgive me." Forgiveness requires sorrow for sin (aka "Contrition") and it requires asking God in a concrete way for His Mercy. Can that be done without the Church? Not really. Yes, in extenuating circumstances, God does grade on a curve... But we don't get to decide what shape that curve may or may not take. The ordinary way in which the Lord intended us to be forgiven of sins is the Sacramental way. Jesus gave Peter the Keys to the Kingdom and He gave Peter instructions to forgive sins or to withhold forgiveness. The Church gives us the Sacrament of Confession which makes being forgiven incredibly easy.

I hope and pray that despite the oddness of our circumstances, each of us will strongly think about the need that we have for a regular Confession and will do what it takes to make that happen.
