## Thoughts from Fr. Ryan

This past week, Abp. Aymond said the words I've been waiting to hear: we can start returning to Mass! As I point out a little later in the bulletin, there are limitations and restrictions... but we can start getting back to Mass!

One of the hardest things to deal with in a nation as large as ours is the simple reality that one policy\plan\program can never, ever be a good fit for 380 million people. I agree 100% with the decision of our Bishops to _abrogate_ everyone's Sunday obligation so that each one can chose for himself whether the risk of personal exposure is too high. I also agree 100% with the decisions of our National, State and local government to allow people to make the personal decision to stay at home in a self-imposed isolation. That said, I do not agree much at all with the one-size-fits-all solution of national quarantine. For one, every metric of data around COVID19 is inconclusive. We don't really know how contagious, how deadly, or how wide-spread it is. We don't know whether quarantine helps or doesn't. We don't know if it is natural, man-made, or a mixture of the two. We don't know who is actually dying from it and who is dying from one of the other strains of flu that naturally pass around. We don't know if masks or gloves actually help. We don't know much of anything about this virus. What we do know is that politicians, newscasters, fearmongers and opportunists are running wild and doing their best to extort the situation for all kinds of personal gain. We also know that this whole quarantine\lockdown thing is going to increase poverty and that increased poverty has its own death toll. Much of that poverty will be the result of leaders in big cities making decisions which are bad for mid-sized cities, towns and rural America.

From the religious point of view, life is something to be praised, honored, and valued, but it is not something to be hoarded in fear. The Lord's promises aren't about a long and happy life in this world. And while it is sinful to throw life and health away needlessly, it is far more vile to prohibit access to the Sacraments and the Eucharistic presence of Jesus for those who want it. True, Catholic Churches closed across Europe a hundred years ago during the Spanish Flu pandemic, but they reopened rather quickly. Many of us have now been more than six weeks without access to Church. Many have died - not from the flu - without access to the Rites and riches of the Church. If our choices arise from genuine love for God and neighbor, then they are virtuous. But if they arise from fear or from a misplaced priority of health over holiness, they are the opposite of virtue. As I said, I agree with the Archbishop's decision to abrogate the obligation to attend Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation. And I'm thankful that he's decided to reopen our Churches. What I think we all need to spend some time soul-searching about is our own motivations and priorities. Is it more important to preserve earthly life or to grow in the spiritual life? When those can happen side by side, they should! But what about when they are in conflict? Where are my priorities? Does my faith give me the strength to risk Earth for Heaven?

## Getting Back to Mass!

Just before May 1, 2020, Archbishop Aymond, acting as the Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese allowed pastors to re-establish a public Mass schedule under specific safety conditions. This follows a general cancellation of all religious services several weeks before Easter of this year.

**At this time, all Catholics in the Diocese of Alexandria are still not obligated to attend Sunday Mass on the order of the Archbishop. Our new Bishop, +Robert Marshall has confirmed this order and will lift the order at a date to be determined.**

Beginning May 4th:

- All Masses will be offered in the "Ordinary Form" (English, Modern form) except where otherwise indicated.
- All daily Masses will be open to the public on a first-come-first-served basis. If you arrive and nine others are present, you're asked to return home.
- Sunday morning Masses will be available for live-stream only but Fr. Ryan will provide several brief Communion Services throughout Sunday Morning to allow for as many as would like to come and receive Holy Communion. Contact Ann to reserve your spot(s).
- No more than ten people in total (including the priest) may attend any service or gathering.
- Holy Communion is available only under the single species of the Sacred Host.
- Fr. Ryan is available and happy to bring Holy Communion to you in your home.
- All are asked and expected to observe the precepts of _social distancing_. Masks and gloves are welcome and recommended, but not required.

Fr. Ryan has been working in cooperation with [CatholicUnderground.com](http://www.CatholicUnderground.com) to provide broad opportunities to assist at Mass over the internet and he will continue to do so until such time as a full Mass schedule can be re-established.

Further information from Archbishop Aymond regarding the re-opening of Public Masses is available at [DioceseAlex.org](http://www.diocesealex.org).
