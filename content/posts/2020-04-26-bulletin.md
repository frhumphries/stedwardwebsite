description: "The Third Sunday of Easter is the time in which we settle into the Season. The full month of spiritually intense feasts and fasts which has included the veiling of the statues and then Palm Sunday and the Holy Week and then Easter Sunday and then Divine Mercy Sunday has comes to an end. The slow, deliberate integration of the fruits of the Lenten Season now begins."

## Thoughts from Fr. Ryan

Well, we have a bishop! I had my first personal contact with him today (Friday, the 24) and I was so very pleased with the experience. Bishop-elect Robert Marshall (whose proper title of address is simply "Bishop") is a very down to Earth man. He was born into a Catholic family. He went to Catholic school, served the altar, and lived the Faith in a very ordinary way. He became an attorney and practiced law near his home. He left his law practice for the priesthood at the age of 35 and was ordained as a priest for the Diocese of Memphis in 2000. He served in several very small parishes on the northern edges of the state of Tennessee and was a well-liked pastor. He's ok in Spanish and so when the need arose, he was appointed to a larger parish with an Hispanic community. He's spent the last three years as the go-to man for fixing problems in the Diocese of Memphis. You may or may not know that Bp. Talley was taken from us because a former bishop of the Diocese of Memphis lost his gourd and started making some truly awful decisions... When that bishop was forced to resign by Pope Francis, it was then-Monsignor Marshall who stepped in and started the work of healing and restructuring. Since Bp. Talley's arrival in Memphis, he's relied heavily on Msgr. Marshall's skills and pastoral good sense. There's no doubt that Bp. Talley has given Bp-elect Marshall the skinny on our diocese.

Bp-elect Marshall is also close to Archbishop Greg Aymond of the Archdiocese of New Orleans who has served as our administrator these past thirteen months. Then-bishop Aymond was the rector of Notre Dame Seminary for all the years that Bp-elect Marshall studied there. He, too, will have given our new Bishop a good background and explanation of our circumstances - the good, the bad, and the in-between.

What does all this mean for us? Well, it means that in a few months, we have a bishop who has lots of the right kind of experience for our diocese. He's got years as a pastor of predominantly smaller parishes. He's got a head for administration. He's good with people. He's been successful with healing hurt parishes. He's got close connections to the two bishops who know us the best and he went to school with several of the priests of our diocese which means he'll be able to hit the ground running with some quality background and contextualized understanding of our diocese.

Perhaps the most important and the hardest part of being a good bishop - or a good pastor - is the balancing act between letting the Church in a given place grow and develop organically and imposing upon it my own ideas, plans, and innovations. It can't be one or the other. The Catholic Church isn't run by committee because the Catholic Faith is not just whatever we want it to be. There's a place for a community having its own local flavor and personality, but the Catholic Faith is the Catholic Faith and it's not whatever this or that community wants it to be. At the same time, the Catholic Faith is not a monolithic set of practices and beliefs which is meant to be imposed like a set of blueprints or a Soviet-era apartment building. The Church is the living, mystical Body of Christ and that body will look a little different in each place and in each time. Bishop-elect Marshall has some excellent information about what makes the Church in Central Louisiana special and unique. He'll gain first-hand knowledge soon enough. As our Bishop, it's the genuine will of the Holy Spirit that his own personality will shape ours as a Diocese. But he's very aware of the fine balance between shaping and forcing. The most exciting and consoling thing I took away from my conversation with him is that he's coming here to be a spiritual father and not a king. He is, interestingly, given the authority of a king in the diocese, but I believe he's going to walk this fine line with skill and humility and so I, for one, am very excited to welcome him to the Diocese as our new Bishop.

As of right now, we just don't have any way of knowing when he’ll be able to move from Memphis to Alexandria and we have no way to predict when his Mass of Consecration will take place. Even when it does, we don’t know what kinds of social distancing policies may be in place. The general rule is that he has three months from the announcement (which was April 21) to take charge. In these uncertain times, Pope Francis would almost certainly extend that period if Bishop-elect Marshall asked him to… As such, all we can do is pray for our new Bishop and look forward to his being among us in a more normal way as soon as possible!

**Stewardship** The disciples on the road to Emmaeus walked and talked with Jesus all day long, but it was not until they offered Him hospitality and He blessed and broke the bread that they recognized Him. Simple acts of loving kindness still reveal the presence of God in our midst.
