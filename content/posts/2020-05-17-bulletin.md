## COVID Quarantine UPDATE

On Monday, May 11, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards instantiated Phase I of President Donald Trump's plan for ending the COVID-19 Quarantine. While we have a long way to go together, this news is especially good for us here at St. Edward. Because we're a small congregation, we are able to get back to our Faith in a way which is very nearly normal.

Beginning May 16th at St. Edward:

- No more than fifty people in total may attend any service or gathering.
- All are asked and expected to observe the precepts of "social distancing." Masks and gloves are welcome and strongly recommended, but not required.
- Holy Communion is available only under the single species of the Sacred Host.
- Our weekly schedule will be gradually adjusted to resemble our usual pre-COVID schedule.
  - Saturday and Sunday Masses will return to normal beginning May 16.
  - Fr. Ryan will begin taking his day-off again on Mondays and so no public Mass will be scheduled.
  - ALL Masses in May will be live-stream unless otherwise indicated, BUT after May, only Masses which are indicated will be live-streamed.
  - Daily Masses will be offered at 9:00a, not 9:15a.
  - When the Legacy Nursing Home (AKA The Olive Branch) reopens for Public Mass, the Thursday will take place there.
  - NOTE: each week for the month or so will be different, so please take a close look at the schedule.
  - THANK YOU for you patience with us and for your cooperation!
