## Thoughts from Fr. Ryan

The Octave Day of Easter was traditionally called Low Sunday. After the forty fasting days of Lent, the seven days of Easter week were usually days of big meals, parties, celebrations and elaborate liturgies. We have to remember that fasting prior to the 1960s was much more common in the Church. Lent wasn't just fasting from one or two food items and abstaining from meat on Friday... Every Monday through Saturday was like Good Friday now. Only one meal was allowed and it couldn't contain any meat or meat broth. And so by the end of the sixth week of fasting, folks were ready for a party... The conclusion of all the initial Easter festivities was a much-needed rest. Hence the name, Low Sunday.

In April of the Great Jubilee year 2000, Pope St. John Paul II declared that Low Sunday would be known as Divine Mercy Sunday and that the devotions prescribed by then-Sister now-Saint Faustina would be officially recognized by the Church. This was actually a fairly controversial issue at the time. For one, St. Faustina wasn't a saint at the time. For another, her writing wasn't broadly known outside of her native Poland. For a third issue, the main text that Sr. Faustina wrote, entitled _Divine Mercy in my Soul_ was and is theologically vague. So much so that her book was on the official list of books which could not be taught in Seminaries and Catholic schools. She has little to say about the role of repentance for personal sin. Her writing also makes a lot of assumptions about the spiritual life which a reader needs to understand before just picking up the book and reading it.

With a proper understanding, the mystical visions which have come to be known as _Divine Mercy_ are relatively simple. The Lord asked a little nun in a small convent outside of Krakow, Poland to have an image painted and to publish a simple set of prayers that could be prayed using a typical Rosary. The image depicts Jesus with two bright rays of light flowing from His wounded side. One of the rays is blue and the other is red. Reproductions of the image typically have a line of text across the bottom reading "Jesus, I trust in You."

The Chaplet of Divine Mercy begins with a Hail Mary, an Our Father and the Apostles' Creed. On the large beads (The Our Father beads), the prayer is said "Eternal Father, I offer you the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world." On the smaller beads (the Hail Mary beads), the prayer is said "For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have mercy on us and on the whole world." At the end, the antiphon for Good Friday's Veneration of the Cross is said three times: "Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us and on the whole world." There are several optional closing prayers which can be added.

What makes Divine Mercy so fascinating isn't the text of the book that St. Faustina wrote. It isn't the neatness of the chaplet or even the Shrine that has been built next to the monastery outside of Krakow. What's amazing is the good fruit that has come from it. As with so many aspects of Christianity, the Lord works powerfully whether we understand why or not. The chaplet of Divine Mercy has changed a lot of lives. It's given people a hunger for repentance. It's opened hearts and it's saved marriages. I don't know why it works so well. That said, I don't know why the Rosary is so powerful either... Whatever the reason, Pope St. John Paul II gave the Church a great gift in Divine Mercy Sunday and we would all do well to pray the chaplet daily.
